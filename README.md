The Project on Excel has been done on raw data which has been extracted from a file named "Bike Dashborad Tutorial" (Downloaded from Alex -The Analyst Github)

The raw file "Bike Dashborad Tutorial" contains only a single worksheet called bike_buyers.

Additionally three new worksheets have been created which are Worksheet, Pivot Table and Dashboard

This projet includes Data Cleaning from the raw data and the cleaned data is stored in a newly created "Worksheet"

Based on this "Worksheet" two new Worksheets have been created which are Pivot Table and Bike Sales Dashboard

This Bike Sales Dashboard contains visualisations based on Bike purchases with respect to Average Income of Purchasers and Non purchasers Gender wise, Customer Age Brackets and Customers Commute.
